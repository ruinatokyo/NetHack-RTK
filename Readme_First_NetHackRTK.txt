Nethack: Remember The Kanji Edition

Release 1.0b

The (in)famous txt-gfx based adventure modified and updated to work for your Japanese study. I've included the original readme files as this is not originally our game. It's a very old RPG, 
it has a beginning, middle, and end, and depending on your tastes, you might like it. Our version comes pre-loaded with the kanji and keywords for Remembering The Kanji 1 
(hereinafter "RTK1").  As default, the game progresses by asking you random questions from the entire book. You cannot kill any monsters, dragons, or anything in the game without 
answering the questions correctly. If you are unsure of the answer or if your answer is wrong, the top panel will display the answer along with your story for the kanji, so it should be a nice aid for some.

If, for example, you are only finished with the first 10 chapters of RTK 1, you can edit the "kanji.csv" file to remove the kanji from the chapters you haven't finished yet, but make sure to make a backup of kanji.csv first. It is a standard comma-separated text file of this format:

NUMBER, KEYWORD, KANJI, MNEMONIC,

Where each field is separated by a comma, and NUMBER is the kanji's number in RTK1, KEYWORD is the kanji's keyword in RTK1, KANJI is the actual kanji character from RTK1, and MNEMONIC is your story to remember the kanji. I've left the MNEMONIC section blank, so you will have to fill in your own stories (cut & paste) or retrieve some from any of the RTK communities on the net. When completed, it should look like these sample lines:

990,use,Žg,a PERSON who's an OFFICER gets "USED" for his abilities
991,convenience,•Ö,as it GROWS LATE a PERSON can only satisfy cravings at a "CONVENIENCE" store

The game will also take RTK3 kanji, and if someone would like to make the RTK3 kanji list in the same CSV format, I would appreciate a copy. As well, you can edit the kanji.csv file to do quizzes on basically anything. So, if you enjoy the game, it could become a good study tool.
